-    1. this example uses Bootstrap/Reactstrap
-    2. so, yarn add bootstrap reactstrap uuid react-transition-group
     - bootstrap: installs bootstrap, which reactstrap uses
     - reactstrap: bootstrap styling library built for React
     - uuid: used to generate random id, but will use DB for id's when DB is connected
     - react-transition-group: ???
