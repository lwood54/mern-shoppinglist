1. This example uses Bootstrap/Reactstrap
2. yarn add bootstrap reactstrap uuid react-transition-group

- bootstrap: installs bootstrap
- reactstrap: bootstrap styling library built for React
- uuid: used to generate random id, but will be replaced by IDs from DB when connected
- react-transition-group: helps with animations

3. Inside the client root index.js file, add the bootstrap css

- bootstrap import: import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css'
