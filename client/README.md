-    1. this example uses Bootstrap/Reactstrap
-    2. yarn add bootstrap reactstrap uuid react-transition-group
           - bootstrap: installs bootstrap, which reactstrap uses
           - reactstrap: bootstrap styling library built for React
           - uuid: used to generate random id, but will use DB for id's when DB is connected
           - react-transition-group: helps with animations
           * why is this still bulleted?
-    3. Inside the client root indes.js file, add the bootstrap css
           - bootstrap import: import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css'
